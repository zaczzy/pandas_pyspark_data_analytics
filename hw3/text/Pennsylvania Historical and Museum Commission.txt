The commission cares for historical manuscripts, public records, and objects of historic interest; museums; archeology; publications; historic sites and properties; historic preservation; geographic names; and the promotion of public interest in Pennsylvania history.

As of April 2014, the chairman is Andrew Masich and the executive director is James Vaughan. PHMC Commissioners as of April 2014 are John A. Barbour, Karen Dougherty Buchholz, Susan M. Corbett, Jim Ferlo, Senator, William V. Lewis, Robert Matzie, Representative, Ann M. Moran, Jean Craige Pepper Victor, Scott Petri, Representative, Fredrick C. Powell, Richard M. Sand, Joseph B.

PHMC Vision: The PHMC enriches people's lives by helping them to understand Pennsylvania's past, to appreciate the present, and to embrace the future.


== Historical marker program ==

The PHMC administers the Historical Marker Program, which installs bronze plaques to commemorate individuals, events, and landmarks throughout the state. The program was launched in 1914 by the Pennsylvania Historical Commission, the predecessor to the PHMC. The signs were redesigned in 1945â€“46 to make them easier to read from a passing car. The PHMC has posted criteria for inclusion for new markers and accepts marker proposals from the public.

PHMC also publishes Pennsylvania Heritage magazine in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Heritage Foundation.
