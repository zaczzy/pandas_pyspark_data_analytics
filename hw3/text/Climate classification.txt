Climate classification systems are ways of classifying the world's climates. A climate classification may correlate closely with a biome category, as climate is a major influence on biological life in a region. The most popular classification scheme is probably the Köppen climate classification scheme.
Climate classification systems include:
Aridity index
Alisov climate classification
Köppen climate classification
Holdridge life zone classification
Trewartha climate classification
Vahl climate classification
