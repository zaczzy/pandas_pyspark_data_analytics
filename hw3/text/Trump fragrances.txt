Businessman Donald Trump has produced several lines of fragrances, including Donald Trump, The Fragrance; Success; and Empire. The Success line was discontinued in 2015 following Trump's negative comments on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. According to the Environmental Working Group in 2016, the fragrances contained ingredients that were linked to various health conditions. As of November 8, 2016, all of Trump's fragrances are reported to be in the process of being discontinued.


== Donald Trump, The Fragrance ==
Trump's first eau de Cologne—Donald Trump, The Fragrance Experience—was produced in partnership with Estée Lauder.


== Success ==
Success was a men's fragrance from Macy's, and was a collaboration between The Trump Organization and Five Star Fragrance Company. This fragrance was launched in March 2012. The scents include blends of fresh juniper and iced red currant, hints of coriander, a mix of frozen ginger, fresh bamboo leaves and geranium, a combination of rich vetiver, tonka bean, birchwood and musk.
In 2012, petitions and protests requested that Macy's "Dump Trump," e.g., stop selling Success and other Trump products due to his statements on topical issues such as climate change and President Obama's citizenship status. The perfume company dropped the line in 2015, following Trump's negative comments about Mexican illegal immigrants.
According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Success smelled like "soap" and was "reminiscent of a fashion magazine that contains too many perfume ads."


== Empire ==
Trump launched the Empire line in March 2015.
