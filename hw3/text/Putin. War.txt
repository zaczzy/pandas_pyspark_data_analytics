"Putin. War" (Russian: Путин. Война) is a report based on materials prepared by the Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov about the 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Published on the website Putin. Itogi on 12 May 2015, it covers the preparations for the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the involvement of Russian troops in the war in Donbass. The report includes testimonials of Russian soldiers taken prisoner in Ukraine and photos of Russian military personnel who died in the hostilities.


== Authors ==
Boris Nemtsov began working on the report at the end of January 2015. After Nemtsov's assassination, his close associate Ilya Yashin headed a team of opposition journalists and activists, who continued writing the report and prepared it for publication.


== Structure and content ==
The epigraph of the report is a post by Boris Nemtsov in Facebook on 31 January 2015:

The task of the opposition today is education and truth.
And the truth is that Putin is war and crisis.

The report consists of a preface, 11 chapters and a conclusion. It has 65 large-format pages with 46 color photographs and 8 charts.
Chapters:
Why Putin needs this war
Lies and propaganda
How they took Crimea
The Russian military in the east of Ukraine
Volunteers or mercenaries?
Cargo 200
Vladimir Putin's Army Depot
Who shot down the Boeing
Who rules the Donbass
The humanitarian disaster
What does the war with Ukraine cost?
Chapters cover the events from the beginning of Euromaidan when the Kremlin developed plans for the "annexation of Crimea" up to the start of 2015. The report includes information from relatives of Russian servicemen who died in Ukraine. The authors write that Putin's "hybrid war" involves doublethink, falsehoods and сowardliness, concluding:

The cowardly and despicable war unleashed by Putin will cost the country a lot. We will be paying for this adventure with the lives of our soldiers, economic crisis and political isolation.
We will pay with enmity from our long-time allies. No people are closer and more like kin to the Russians than the Ukrainians. These are our brothers - without any pathos -- and the war between Russians and Ukrainians in Donbass is impossible to characterize in any other way except as fratricide.
This war is the shame of our country. But the problem will not go away by itself. Putin must be stopped. And this can only be done by the Russian people themselves.
Let us stop this war together.
